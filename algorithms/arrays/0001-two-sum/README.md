# Two Sum

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the
two numbers such that they add up to target.

Rules:
- Exactly one solution exists.
- Do not use the same element twice.
- Order of indices does not matter.

Example:
nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 -> [0,1]
